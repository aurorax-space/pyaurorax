# All Sky Imagers

All Sky Imagers, or ASIs in short form, are cameras that collect images of auroral phenomenon using a wide-angle fisheye lens. The "all sky" aspect is what differentiates them from other types of data since they capture horizon-to-horizon images.


## Examples of Data

Below are some examples of data.

## Keograms

Keograms are images that represent a period of time of data from an ASI. The centre column of each frame is extracted and stacked left-to-right to form the keogram. North is at the top, south at the bottom, and time runs from left-to-right.

Below is one example of keograms with several stacked vertically. The top frames are all from a certain time identified by the red lines, each image is from a different ASI (left to right and top to bottom: TREx Blueline, TREx NIR, TREx RGB, REGO).
